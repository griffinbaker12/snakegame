My implementation of the classic snake game - play here: https://app.netlify.com/sites/brilliant-platypus-52e0e9.

Implementation Highlights: 
- 3 levels of difficulty
- Persists data across reloads

Additional Details to Consider:
- Reverse the snake upon eating a "special apple"
- Store scores in a database with other users to generate a leaderboard
